Coherent detection (OOK, BPSK(sync detection), FSK) 
Non-coherent detection (OOK, FSK, DPSK)
$\text{bandpass waveform: }s(t)=R\{g(t)e^{j\omega_{c}t}\}\implies \text{Avg normalized power: }P_{S} \frac{<s^2(t)>}{R}=\frac{1}{2}<|g(t)|^2> \implies \text{Peak envelope power (PEP): }P_{PEP}=\frac{1}{2R}[max|g(t)|]^2\implies \text{Normalized PEP: }P_{PEP,norm}=\frac{1}{2}[max|g(T)|]^2$
$T=\frac{1}{R}$ 
$T_{0}=lT$ 
$f_{0}=D=\frac{1}{T_{0}}=\frac{R}{l}$
$B_{null}=2R$
**OOK (On-off Keying)(Amplitude Shift Keying ASK)**
$s(t)=x(t)\cos(\omega_{c}t)\to x(t)=A_{c}m(t)$
$T=\frac{1}{R(\text{bits/s})}$
$T_{0}=lT$
$\text{periodic: }T_{0}=2T$ and $f_{0}=\frac{1}{T_{0}}=\frac{1}{2T}=\frac{R}{2}\text{ in general }f_{0}=D=\frac{R}{l}\text{ and }T_{0}=lT$
$\text{first zero: }B_{\omega_{T}}=2(2f_{0})$ in general absolute bandwidth $B_{T}=2B$
bandpass waveform: $s(f)=\frac{1}{2}[x(f-f_{c})+x^*(-f-f_{c})]\implies x(f)=\sum^\infty_{-\infty}c_{n}\delta(f-nf_{0})$
$x(t)=\sum^\infty_{\infty}c_{n}e^{jn\omega_{0}t}\implies \text{coeff}=c_{n}=\frac{1}{T_{0}}\int ^{T_{0}/4} _{-T_{0}/4} A_{c}e^{-jn\omega_{0}t} \, dt=\dots=\frac{A_{c}}{2} \frac{\sin\left( n \frac{\pi}{2} \right)}{n \frac{\pi}{2}}$plug that into $x(f)$
$\text{frequency spectrum: }S(f)=\frac{1}{2}[X(f-f_{c})+X^*(-f-f_{c})]$
![[5XTA0/attachments/ook signal.png|400]]
**BPSK (Phase Shift Keying PSK)**
$s(t)=A_{c}\cos[\omega_{c}t+D_{p}m(t)]$
![[bpsk signal.png|300]]![[bpsk signal-1.png|222]]
**FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)**
$s(t)=Re[g(t) \cdot e^{j\omega_{t}t}]\text{ where }g(t)=A_{c}=e^{j\theta(t)}\text{ and }\theta(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t} m(\tau) \, d\tau$
but for FSK $g(t)$ is hard to evaluate so we use carsons rule $B_{T}=2(\Delta F+B)$ where $B=f_{0}(1+r)\text{ where }f_{0}=\frac{R}{l}$
if sinc pulse $B=R$


always use carsons rule for FSK.
requires approximation. $f_{center}=f_{c}=\frac{f_{1}+f_{2}}{2}$
$h=\frac{2\Delta F}{R}\text{ where }\Delta F=f_{1}-f_{c}$
$\beta=\frac{\Delta F}{B}\to B=R\text{ so }B_{T}=2(\beta+1)B$
cosine roll-off: $r=\frac{f_{\Delta}}{f_{0}}\text{ so }B=f_{0}(1+r)\text{ where there is zeros at: }t=\frac{n}{2f_{0}}\text{ for no ISI }D_{max}=2f_{0}$
$\text{envelope decay: }\frac{1}{|t|^3}$ and $\text{sinc pulse: }r=0\text{ where } \frac{1}{2}f_{0}$
$f_{0}=\frac{R}{2}$

![[spectral effiency of bandpass signal.png|300]]

![[null to null 2nd.png|300]]
BPSK: Not bandwidth efficient but not sensitive to amplitude variation and requires only two decision points: binary 1 and 0 separated by 180 deg. 

QPSK: More bandwidth efficient than BPSK but requires more decision points than BPSK. Has a complex carrier symbol with each level having 90 deg phase shift. Requires 4 decision points. Multilevel modulation formats: More bandwidth efficient in order to achieve the same data rate. However, higher order modulations are more complex to generate, e.g encoding and decoding bits, requiring more processing power and costly equipment.

### Basics of MAC Strategies
media access (MAC) protocol for multi user communication.
**media access control:**
- Multiplexing ('point-to-point' communication)

**multiplexing**
[Multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing)
- Permanent sender-receiver connections.
- Receivers optimized for specific signals.
- Data can be continuous or packet-based, needing synchronization.
- Channels defined by physical parameters (e.g., time, frequency).
**multiple access**
[Channel access method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_access_method)
- Multiple stations access and share one channel.
- Receivers handle varying transmissions and select the correct one.
- Transmission starts with a preamble for synchronization.
- Examples include Ethernet and cellular systems.
- MAC differs from MUX but both manage channel access.
- Stations are logically separated by time, frequency, or code to avoid collisions.

$\text{frequency division: }N=\frac{B_{t}-B_{guard}}{B_{c}}\text{ and adding time division: }N=\frac{m(B_{t}-B_{guard})}{B_{c}}$

### TDMA
[Time-division multiple access - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access)
Shares single carrier frequency with multiple users
Less power control than CDMA, but more flexible than FDMA
Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot.
![[TDMA sharing medium.png|300]]
required Time Division Duplex TDD.
$\text{number of carriers in a cell cluster}=\frac{B_{system}-B_{guard}}{B_{channel}}\to carriers$
$\text{users/cell}=\frac{carriers}{\text{cells in cluster}}$
$\text{trunking efficiency}=\eta_{T}=\frac{\text{Traffic in Erlang}}{Number of Channels} \cdot100\text{ TE increases as num of channel per cell increase, num of cells per cluster determine TE}$
![[trunking effiency.png|200]]
$\text{num of simultaneous users each call cluster}=\text{duplex carriers} \cdot \text{slots fit in channel}$
$\text{num cells}=\text{covered area} / \text{area per cell}$
$\text{num carriers per cell}=\text{total num carriers}/\text{num cells per cluster}$
$\text{num channels per cell}=\text{num of time slots per carrier} \cdot \text{num carriers per cells}$
now we can calculate trunking efficiency

$\text{avg user density}=\text{num users per cell}/\text{cell area}$
### CDMA
[Code-division multiple access - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-division_multiple_access)
allows several users to share a band of frequencies.
it uses spread spectrum mentioned before. Using spread spectrum or spectrum hopping
$\text{spreading factor}\to G=\frac{W}{R}\text{ transmission bandwidth W and information bandwidth R(data rate)}$
faster hopping -> less probability jammer would interact with your frequency
![[direct sequence.png|300]]![[direct sequence against interferer.png|300]]
and vice versa if the jammer is spread
interference power of jamming signal reduced with processing gain: $G=\frac{R_{c}}{R_{b}}$
![[slow and fast FHSS multiple access.png|300]]

$\text{to accomodate max certain amount of users: } \frac{E_{b}}{I_{0}}=\frac{NP}{N_{0}+(K-1)P}=\dots dB$
$\text{max num of users: }K=\frac{N}{E_{b}/I_{0}}-\frac{1}{P/N_{0}}+1$
where power per chip: $P$ and bandwidth: $N$
### NOMA
**Non Orthogonal Multiple Access**
uses power domain to separate signals.
![[oma vs noma.png|300]]![[oma vs noma-1.png|300]]

- users with better channel conditions, like a closer channel are allocated less power...
- Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is used at receivers.
![[nima beamforming.png|300]]
### Transmission Media
![[transmission media.png|300]]![[optical fiber transmission system.png|300]]
**attenuation:** signal get smaller.
**dispersion:** signals get mis-shaped.
**Numerical aperture** (a measure for the coupling efficiency of light into the fiber).
**numerical aperture** (**NA**) of an optical system is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

- UDP being a connectionless protocol, them messages are forwarded without establishing a connection between the two communicators...
- A UDP datagram consists of a datagram _header_ followed by a _data_ section (the payload data for the application). The UDP datagram header consists of 4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits)

 **hosts** connected over **communication links** which do **packet switching and routing.**
 **packet-switching:** hosts break application-layer messages into packets. Packets go from router to router, to connect ISPs (internet service providers).
 ![[packet switching.png|200]]![[two key network core.png|200]]
- packet switching has queueing and delays.
- Circuit switching reserves a dedicated physical path for the entire connection duration. (can be TDM or FDM based).
- It is connection-oriented; a path must be established before data transmission.
- Packet switching, a connectionless method, sends data packets independently without a dedicated path.
- ISPs communicate between IXPs (Internet exchange point)
- Regional networks may arise to connect access nets to ISPS
- content provider networks  (e.g., Google, Microsoft,   Akamai ) may run their own network, to bring services, content close to end users.

In the datagram-forwarding model of packet delivery, packet headers contain a destination address. It is up to the intervening switches or routers to look at this address and get the packet to the correct destination.
[1.4: Datagram Forwarding - Engineering LibreTexts](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Networks/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Networks_(Dordal)/01%3A_An_Overview_of_Networks/1.04%3A_Datagram_Forwarding)


- A datagram network is **a computer network system that transmits and receives individual data packets**. It has a header that defines its source and destination addresses, in addition to additional data needed to transmit the packet.
- reordering is done by the receiver.
- The link layer, built upon the physical layer, specifies the protocols for sending and receiving bit packets, with Ethernet being the protocol used

A switching loop, or bridge loop, **occurs when more than one path exists between the source and destination devices**.
![[bridging with loops.png|300]]
loops are not something we want to end up with as it fills the routing tables with redundancy.

### Spanning Trees
[Spanning Tree Protocol Explained | Step by Step - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=japdEY1UKe4)
#### STP Analysis Summary
**Problems without STP:**
- Communication loops formed
- Unstable MAC address tables
- Duplicate Frames

**Solution with STP:**
- Just mark one port in a switch to be ignored

**How to do STP:**
- Elect root bridge
- Place root interfaces into forwarding state
- Each non-root switch selects its root port
- Remaining links choose a designated port
- All other ports are put in to a blocking state

![[STP basic setup.png|300]]
#### other

The need for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) arose because switches in local area networks (LANs) are often interconnected using redundant links to improve resilience should one connection fail.  However, this connection configuration creates a switching loop resulting in broadcast radiations and MAC table instability.  If redundant links are used to connect switches, then switching loops need to be avoided.


[Spanning Tree Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol)
[Switching loop - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_loop)
Hubs are L1, which form connection to devices, and are interconnected through bridges forming a network.
![[interconnected ethernets.png|400]]
**circles: switches(bridges), squares: hubs(terminal,node)**
- One bridge is the root Union of shortest paths to root = spanning tree.
- Many spanning trees possible Bridge B2 out of tree Ports in B7, B4 deactivated.
- Rule 1: Root = bridge with smallest ID. **B1**
- Rule 2: Each network has one designated bridge closest to the root. Each bridge selects the port that gives best path to root. **why B3 eliminated**
- Rule 3: If two bridges tie in distance from the root, the smallest ID wins **Distance = # hops**. **why loop to B7 disconnected**. $dist=bridge-bridge$

![[stp 3.png|300]]
**limitations of bridges:**
- Forwarding tables can get huge: one entry per node!
- Too much flooding until forwarding tables converge
- Trees can be misbalanced
	- Bridges can become hotspots

### Address Resolution Protocol & L2 to L3 traversal (Link Layer Routing & ARP)
**Address Resolution Protocol**
Table of IP <-> physical address bindings: entries expire after 15min

Step 1: broadcast request if IP not in table
Step 2: target machine responds with its physical address
Step 3: table refresh at receiver machines
	If requestor already in table, restart expiration timer
	Else if receiver=target machine, add entry for requestor
	Else, do not update
Physical address could be an extra column of routing table
![[addr res protocol.png|400]]

**hub: L1**
**router: L3**
**left part is L2**
![[l2 to l3 traversal.png|400]]
- Assume that every device has empty forwarding tables.
- Show all the steps taken by the network so that HTTP request from A reaches S.
1. ARP request with target address 200.0.0.11
	1. Router rejects the request as target is in same domain as requestor
	2. S replies with own MAC address
2. Frame composed and sent to MAC 8A:53
3. Switch checks on forwarding table and forwards directly to S
4. IP identifies target address 156.64.199.21 is out of local domain. Go to gateway 200.0.1.1
5. ARP request with target address 200.0.1.1
	1. Router replies with own MAC address 71:D4
6. Frame composed and sent to MAC 71:D4
7. Router checks on routing table and forwards directly through eth1 to 156.64.199.21
### Traversal Exercise
**Forwarding (link layer):** select an output port based on destination address and routing table.
**Routing (network layer):** process by which routing table is built.
![[fowarding table.png|300]]![[routing table.png|300]]
**routing tables:**
![[traversal and router table.png|400]]
router: L3
everything before the router to the right: L2
hub: L1 so we skip it since A is L2
![[address resolution protocol-1.png|300]]

**Assume that every edge device has empty forwarding tables. Show all the steps taken by the**
**network so that HTTP request from A reaches S and another one reaches W.**
![[telecom structure.png|400]]
**S:**
1. ARP request with target address **200.0.0.11**
	1. Router rejects the request as target is in same domain as requestor
	2. S replies with own MAC address
2. Frame composed and sent to MAC **8A:53**
3. Switch checks on forwarding table and forwards directly to S
![[more indepth view.png|400]]
**W:**
1. IP identifies target address **156.64.199.21** is out of local domain. Go to gateway **200.0.1.1**
2. ARP request with target address **200.0.1.1**
	1. Router replies with own MAC address **71:D4**
3. Frame composed and sent to MAC **71:D4**
4. Router checks on routing table and forwards directly through **eth1** to **156.64.199.21**

###  Internetworking & Reliable Transport
#### Internet Protocol Packets
![[ip packet format.png|400]]
![[router data transmission packets.png|300]]![[packet fragmentation.png|300]]
**IP Packet Fragmentation**
- One IP packet split into multiple link-layer packets
- One IP packet split into multiple link-layer packets
- **Indent** (Identifier of fragment sequence), **Flags**(More fragments to follow?), **Offset** (pointer to the first byte from original IP packet this payload corresponds to measured in 8-byte blocks)

#### IP Subnets
[Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
- Physical networks with same Network ID
- Network IDs from class A or B addresses
- IP split: $\text{network-num.subnet-id.host-id}$
- Network IDs from class A or B addresses
- subnet_mask AND ip_address = subnet_number
- subnet_number = $\text{network-num.subnet-id}$
![[ip subnet example.png|300]]![[i subnet forwarding.png|300]]
![[ip subnet forwarding.png|300]]![[classless adressing CIDR.png|300]]

![[CIDR.png|400]]
- Group addresses under common prefixes
- Instead of subnet masks use /X notation
- Assumed subnet masks of X first bits equal to 1
- 192.4.16/20 represents all addresses from 192.4.16 to 192.4.31
