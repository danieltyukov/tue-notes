>[!NOTE]
>In electrical systems, there are two types of power: active and reactive. Active power does the actual work, like spinning a motor. Reactive power, however, doesn't do any work but is necessary for the functioning of magnetic fields in inductive loads like motors.
>
Inductive loads, like motors, need reactive power to create magnetic fields, which is crucial for their operation. But, they absorb this reactive power from the grid, which can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs.
>
>This is where capacitors come in. Capacitors provide a kind of reactive power that offsets the one absorbed by inductive loads. Think of it like a balance. On one side, you have inductive loads absorbing reactive power (making it positive), and on the other side, you have capacitors supplying it (making it negative). By balancing these two, the overall demand for reactive power from the grid is reduced, leading to a more efficient and cost-effective system.
>
>So, capacitors are used to "compensate" or balance out the reactive power in the system, making it more efficient.

# Conventional generation & control of electrical power

- An alternator or synchronous generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction, i.e., **when the flux linking a conductor changes, an EMF is induced in the conductor**. When the armature winding of alternator subjected to the rotating magnetic field, the voltage will be generated in the armature winding.

max power of synchronous generator: $P_{max}=\frac{EV}{X_{S}}$
**power frequency control:** control of active power and frequency
**controlling reactive power(Q):** AVR (automatic voltage regulator), varies (E)
**controlling active power(P):** Power-frequency control (inversely proportional), (speed up generator less power)

>$\vec{F}=l(\vec{i}\times \vec{B})$
>$f=\frac{pn}{120}$ or $f=\frac{Pn}{60}$ where p: number of poles, P: number of pole pairs, f: frequency, n: num of revolutions

Underground cables currently have a limited voltage capacity and cannot carry more than 66kv. In contrast, **overhead power lines can handle more than 400kv**, making them ideal for serving high-energy needs such as industrial applications.
![[overhead-underground.png|400]]

**overhead lines:** 
- $Q_{l}=3\omega Li^2$, $Q_{c}=3\omega CV_{an}^2$
- $I_{c}=\omega V_{an}C$, $A=\frac{\rho l}{R}$, $\Delta P_{v}=\frac{I^2_{new}}{I^2}$
- $Q_{begin}=Q_{connection}-Q_{delivery}$

short line model: $l<80km$ or $V<69kV$
$\pi$ model when: $l<250km$ then $I_{end}=\frac{I_{begin}}{2}$
**The reactive power of the connection always exists**

Power cables : 
	1 Can be seen as a capacitor, under both loaded and unloaded conditions. 
	2 Have a short circuit impedance that is mainly resistive.
Overhead lines : 
	1 An unloaded line behaves capacitive. 
	2 At increasing load, a line behaves resistive, and then inductive. 
	3 Their short circuit impedance is mainly inductive.
$P_{loss}=P_{1}-P_{2}=I^2R$
$Q_{loss}=Q_{1}-Q_{2}=I^2X$

###### Transformer
eddy current losses: $\frac{V_{Prim}^2}{R_{core}}$
hysteresis losses: $V_{Prim}^2$

**Coil 1 is normally in delta connection, coil 2 in star connection.**

Zero load = iron losses = secondary nominal voltage, primary side open circuit.

Copper losses are primary side short circuited , secondary side lower voltage.

Short Circuit = Copper Loss = Given Power loss. At no load measure the iron losses, under short circuit the conductor losses.

Disadvantages transformer is saturated B-H curve, Hysteresis losses, Eddy Current losses.

![[iron-losses-open-circuit.png|400]]![[copper-losses-short-circuit.png|400]]![[transformer-model.png|500]]

$V_{2}=V_{1}\cdot \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}$, $I_{2}=I_{1}\cdot \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}$, $E_{2}=E_{1}\cdot \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}$
Zero Load Losses = $P_{iron,loss}=\sqrt{ 3 }V_{l}I\cos(\theta)$
$I_{coil_{1}}=\frac{\frac{1}{3}\cdot S}{V_{l_{1}}}=\frac{I_n}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$
$I_{n}=\frac{S}{\sqrt{ 3 }\cdot V_{l}}$
$I_{coil_{2}}=I_{n_{2}}$
$P_{loss,copper@70\%}=0.7^2\cdot P_{normal,copper}$

# Network calculations and protection
remedies to consume less reactive power: limit **power factor:** $\cos \phi>0.85$, power factor correction at the load
![[power-factor-correction.png|400]]

Load flow calculations are **used to determine the voltage, current, and real and reactive power at various points in a power system under normal steady-state conditions**.

- Transient faults - Do not damage insulation permanently
###### Circuit Breakers
- Disconnecter can only switch under the absence of current. Circuit breaker must be able to interrupt short circuit current as well (up to 80 kA).
- Breakdown will occur at weakest location an ”arc” will start until the magnetic energy will have been dissipated. The arc will not stop before $0.5\cdot L\cdot i^2=0$

Power losses in high voltage line:
single phase: $S_{1}-S_{2}=V_{1}I-V_{2}I=I^2R+jI^2X$
$P_{loss}=P_{1}-P_{2}=I^2R$
$Q_{loss}=Q_{1}-Q_{2}=I^2X$
**voltages are phase-voltages, $P_{loss}\cap Q_{loss}$ are per phase!**

**WITH ASYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR YOU CAN CONTROL $Q$ REACTIVE POWER**
remember the power flow example:
![[async-gen.png|100]]![[sync gen.png|100]]
![[capacitive inductive.png|400]]
async generator always needs reactive power as it is connected to the grid.
while sync connected to grid directly which can control the voltage so only needs $P$
smaller current -> larger voltage as less power drop over transport line since you generate more -> in positive capacitive load case
