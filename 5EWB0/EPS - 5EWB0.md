>Real power, also known as active power (P) is consumed by resistive loads. Reactive power (Q) is either consumed by inductive loads or generated by capacitive loads. Apparent power (S) is the capacity of your measured power system to provide real and reactive power.

#### Electrical Power

>[!NOTE] Analysis of a Series RL Circuit
>**inductive reactance:** $X_{L}=\omega L=2\pi fL$
>$X_{C}=\frac{1}{\omega C}$
>**circuit impedance:** $Z=\sqrt{ R^2 +X_{L}^2}$
>**capacitive,inductive:** $C=\frac{1}{2\pi fX_{c}},X_{c}=\frac{V^2}{Q(kvar)}=\frac{V^2}{S^*_{c}}$
>**resistance:** $\frac{V^2}{P(w)}$
>
>A positive phase angle would mean the current leads the voltage.
>A negative phase angle means the current lags the voltage.
>
>The **power factor (PF)** is defined as the cosine of the angle (θ) between the apparent power and active power, which is given by:
>$PF=\cos(\theta)=\frac{P}{S}=\frac{P}{VA}$ Higher Better, Low: more inductive loads, higher $\phi$, more Q, -> Higher cost, system losses, cable diameter inc.
