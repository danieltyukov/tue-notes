# Orthogonal basis and the Fourier transform/series
### Orthogonal Basis
The dot product of vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{w} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i$. A set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ is linearly independent if the only solution to $c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = 0$ is $c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_k = 0$. These vectors span a space $W$ if every vector in $W$ can be expressed as a linear combination of them. For instance, the vectors $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$ as any vector $\mathbf{v} = (a, b, c)$ can be written as $a\mathbf{i} + b\mathbf{j} + c\mathbf{k}$. The standard bases for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$ are defined by $\mathbf{i} = (1, 0)$, $\mathbf{j} = (0, 1)$ and $\mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0)$, $\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)$, $\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)$ respectively.

$orthogonal:u \cdot v=0$; if each vector in set $length:|v|=1\implies orthonormal$
gram shcmidt: $\mathbf{u}_1 = \mathbf{v}_1, \quad \mathbf{u}_k = \mathbf{v}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{u}_j, \mathbf{u}_j \rangle} \mathbf{u}_j \quad \text{for } k = 2, \ldots, n.$
### Fourier series
$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T},f=\frac{1}{T}, \omega=2\pi f$
$e^{jk\omega t}=\cos(k\omega t)+j\sin(k\omega t)$
any periodic function may be approximated by a limited series of sines and cosine functions
conversion between time & frequency domain
![[fourier series and fourier transform.png]]
Commonly encountered, periodic signal shapes such as rectangular, squarewave or sawtooth may be described using only one of the two base functions ($sin \text{ or }cos$), since the only differentiating factor between the two is a phase delay of $90\degree$.
$F(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\cdot \cos(\omega t) \, dt \text{ or } F(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\cdot \sin(\omega t) \, dt$$

$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right)$

$a_n = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} f(t) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) dt$

$b_n = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} f(t) \cdot \sin\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) dt$

- Differentiation in Time (time): $\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} (j2\pi f)X(f)$
- Integration in Time (time): $\int_{-\infty}^{t} x(\tau)d\tau \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \frac{X(f)}{j2\pi f} + \pi X(0)\delta(f)$

- Fourier coefficients are numerical values that represent the **magnitude and phase** of the sine and cosine components of a periodic function when it is expressed as a Fourier series. (sometimes a negative coefficient considered in sine/cosine general wave).
- The Fourier series is a way to represent a complex periodic waveform as a combination of simple sine and cosine waves.
- $a_{n}$ cosine coefficients, $b_{n}$ sine coefficients
### Decibels
power amplification: $G=\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$
$G_{dB}=10\log_{10}G=10\log_{10} \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$
$G=10^{G_{dB}/10}$
power attenuation: $L=\frac{1}{G}=\frac{P_{in}}{P_{out}}$
$L_{dB}=10\log_{10}L=10\log_{10} \frac{P_{in}}{P_{out}}$
$L=10^{L_{dB}/10}$

**band-limited:** signal has non-zero frequency components only for a limited part of the frequency spectrum.
**time-limited:** signal has non-zero amplitude only for a limited part of the time
**A waveform is either time-limited or band-limited; not both**

sampling: continous to discrete time signal:
$m(t)$ **(band limited)**![[analog signal.png|100]] -->$M(\omega)$![[fourier transformed analog signal spectrum.png|100]]$\omega_{m}=$max freq ($B-bandwidth$)
(dirac comb) $c(t)=\sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}\delta(t-nT_{s})$where $\delta(t)=1$ for $t=0$, $\delta(t)=0$ for $t\neq 0$![[continuous periodic time signal.png|100]]$T_{s}=$sampling period, $\omega_{s}=\frac{2\pi}{T_{s}}=$sampling freq -->$C(\omega)=\omega_{s}\sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}\delta(\omega-n\omega_{s})$ 
sampler: $c(t)\cdot m(t)=s(t)$![[continous sample signal.png|100]]-->fourier transform: $s(\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi}[M(\omega)*C(\omega)]$-->$S(\omega)$![[spectrum sample signal.png|100]]for no overlapping Nyquistâ€™s sampling rate criteria: $\omega_{s}\geq 2\omega_{m}$ also must be band limited. 

now we represent continuous signal $m(t)$ in continuous samples $s(t)$ and it can be recovered if no overlapping (aliasing).

### Reconstruction

$s(t)$-->LPF(low-pass-filter) $H(\omega)$![[low pass filter signal.png|100]]-->$m_{r}(t)$-->fourier transform: $M_{r}(\omega)$ then $H(\omega)=\frac{M_{r}(\omega)}{S(\omega)}$ so $M_{r}(\omega)=H(\omega)\cdot S(\omega)$![[recovered analog signal spectrum.png|100]]-->inverse fourier transform: $m_{r}(\omega)$
![[low pass filter applied on the sample signal.png|400]]
$\omega_{m}\leq \omega_{c}\leq \omega_{s}-\omega_{m}$
$m(t)=\sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}m_{n} \frac{\sin\left( \pi f_{s}\left[ \frac{n}{f_{s}} \right] \right)}{\pi f_{s}\left[ t-\left( \frac{n}{f_{s}} \right) \right]}$
# Sampling Methods (Pulse Amplitude Modulation)
### Gating (natural sampling)
Natural sampling is a method where an analog signal $w(t)$ is allowed to pass through for a certain amount of time $\tau$ , and then not allowed again
![[gating.png|400]]
$w_{s}(t)=w(t)\cdot s(t)$ or $W_{s}(f)=W(f)*S(f)$
clock with duty cycle: $d=\frac{\tau}{T_{s}}$ can do it
$\omega_{s}(t)=\sum^\infty_{k=-\infty}\omega(kT_{s})h(t-kT_{s}) \text{ where } h(t) = \Pi\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right) \text{ so }w_s(t) = h(t) * \left[ w(t) \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - kT_s) \right]$
fourier series: $W_{s}(f)=d\sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}=\sin c(nd)W(f-nf_{s})$ first zero of bandwidth: $f=\frac{1}{\tau}$
![[gating sample spectrum.png|400]]
$\sin(nd)=\sin c(n\tau f)=\sin c\left( n\tau  \frac{1}{T_{s}} \right)=\sin\left( \frac{n}{3} \right)$
### Flat-top sampling (instantaneous sampling)
In flat-top sampling, the value of the analog signal is captured at the sampling instant $kT_{s}$ and held constant for the duration of the sample pulse $\tau$
Unlike gated sampling, which results in a sampled signal with varying amplitude during the sample time, Flat-top sampling produced a single voltage value for the duration of the sampling pulse duration. This makes it a practical method since the fixed value can be easily converted into a digital value.
![[flat top sampling.png|400]]
$w_{s}(t)=\sum^\infty_{k=-\infty}\omega(kT_{s})h(t-kT_{s})$ where $h(t)$ squere pulse
fourier series: $W_{s}(f)=\frac{1}{T_{s}}|H(f)|\sum^\infty_{k=-\infty}|W(f-kf_{s})|$ where $H_f=d\sin c(\tau f)$
![[flat top sampling-1.png|400]]
some high-frequency components might be altered, due to the filtering effect of flat-top sampling. This is known as aperture effect.
- resolved by narrowing pulse width $\tau$
- equalization filter with transfer func $\frac{1}{H(f)}$ where $H(f)$ e transfer function of flat-top sampling
